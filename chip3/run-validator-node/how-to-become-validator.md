# How to become Validator

**Validator** is an entity that wants to provide answers to **CHIP3 Protocol** and earn tokens for this job. **Validator** needs to main parts to work:

* **Validator Node** - Publicly available server app. Node can subscribe to tasks and execute their requests. Still, to take part in real consensus, Node should have credentials to **Oracle Validator Contract** that controls a wallet with enough (more than **Minimum Validator Stake**) CHIP3 tokens.
* **Validator Stake** - amount of tokens that validator should lock to be able to participate in Task auctions and processing.
