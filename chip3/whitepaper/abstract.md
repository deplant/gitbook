# Abstract

Ultimate goal of decentralized networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Everscale is eliminating trust between network participants.

Bitcoin shown the way for trustless value transfers, Ethereum done this for trustless contracts, but limited to info available to network.&#x20;

TVM blockchains like Everscale targets scalability to extend these achievents to worldwide adoption.

In this paper we describe the architecture, components, governance and tokenomics of TrueQuery - trustless oracle protocol based on asynchronous blockchain.
