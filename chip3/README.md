# Overview

**CHIP3 Oracle Service** is a customizable decentralized Oracle protocol that provides an ability to receive external world data in Venom blockchain contracts.&#x20;

**Oracles** provide a way for the decentralized Web3 ecosystem to access external data sources, legacy systems, and advanced computations. Oracle protocols enable the creation of hybrid smart-contracts, where **on-chain code** and **off-chain data** are combined to support advanced decentralized applications (dApps) that react to real-world events and interoperate with traditional systems.

To get most out of this docs, go to the section that describes you better in the following list.
