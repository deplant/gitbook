# Overview

**TrueQuery Oracle** is a customizable decentralized Oracle protocol that provides an ability to receive external world data in Venom blockchain contracts.&#x20;

**Oracles** provide a way for the decentralized Web3 ecosystem to access external data sources, legacy systems, and advanced computations. Oracle protocols enable the creation of hybrid smart-contracts, where **on-chain code** and **off-chain data** are combined to support advanced decentralized applications (dApps) that react to real-world events and interoperate with traditional systems.

To get most out of this docs, go to the section that describes you better in the following list.

### How to connect

If  you're a **Consumer**, a service that is interested in connecting to **Data Feeds** and receive trusted answers, check our **Using Existing Feeds** section:

[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### How to pay

If you want to act as a **Payer** - wallet holder that wants to deposit funds and allow **Consumer** to spend them on **TrueQuery Oracle** usage. Usually it's the owner of **Consumer** service. Check our notes on account management:

{% content-ref url="connecting-to-existing-feeds/creating-payer-account.md" %}
[creating-payer-account.md](connecting-to-existing-feeds/creating-payer-account.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### How to build

**Task Maintainer** - someone who wants to create **Single Tasks** or **Data Feeds**, run them for Consumers, maintain, update and configure Tasks.

{% content-ref url="build-new-feeds/task-designer-ui.md" %}
[task-designer-ui.md](build-new-feeds/task-designer-ui.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### How to earn

**Validator** - entity interested in installing **Validator Node** product and depositting enough token stake into **TrueQuery Protocol**. **Validator** earns money for providing trusted, consensus-checked answers to Tasks.

{% content-ref url="run-validator-node/how-to-become-validator.md" %}
[how-to-become-validator.md](run-validator-node/how-to-become-validator.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

**TrueQuery DAO** - Maintainer of key **Data Feed** tasks & controller of key protocol configs like fees, stakes & code upgrades.
