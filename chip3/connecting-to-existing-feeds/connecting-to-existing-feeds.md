# Connecting to existing Feeds

To connect your smart-contract to existing **TrueQuery Oracle** data feed, you should do these steps:

* Open [Feed Explorer](http://chip3.deplant.tech/feed-explorer) page and filter existing feeds or search for exact name. If you want to make your own custom Feed, go to [Build Section](broken-reference) for more info.&#x20;
* Write down Feed address.
* Create (or edit) a smart-contract that will send requests to chosen task
* Deploy consumer smart-contract to supported network
* Deposit enough funds to pay for trusted answers
* Issue a new Allowance permission for your deployed smart-contract
